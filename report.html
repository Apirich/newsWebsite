Introduction:<br>
Demo of a website about lifestyle. Contain 5 pages:<br>
Mainpage: popular and special materials.<br>
Artspage: art of living, digital arts, and traditional arts.<br>
Travelpage: places to visit around the world.<br>
Foodpage: must try cuisine around the world.<br>
Searchpage: return search results.<br>

<br>
Inspiration:<br>
Share and enjoy a simple yet healthy, happy life.<br>
The beauty of the nature after my trip to Hawaii.<br>
I'm a food person and I would like to try all the good food around the world.<br>

<br>
Accessibility:<br>
Responsible on all devices (mobiles, tablets, laptops,...), therefore, users can easily access the website.<br>
If users' browsers don't support medias then alternative text will be displayed.<br>
Articles are embedded with videos and photos to bring excitement to users and for those who are not able to read the contents still can guess an ideas by looking or watching the medias.<br>

<br>
Usability:<br>
Users can learn how to improve on quality of life.<br>
Users can look for places to travel or food to enjoy.<br>
Users can see differences between arts forms, hence the development of the society.<br>

<br>
Learning:<br>
Basic ideas about how to store and retrieve datas.<br>
Using button type with onclick on a form will need extra code to close the form but input values will be stored. Using submit type with onsubmitted will automatically close the form but input values will not be stored.<br>
CSS doesn't need to be adjusted if HTML tags come with ID or class. For example: adjust on span and button tags will not cause any changes on CSS.<br>
I wrote from really simple codes and step by step figure out how to adjust the codes to run in the way that I want them to be.<br>

<br>
Evaluation I:<br>
Signup and login are in one button.<br>
I think all in one button is more friendly-user if the required data is simple.<br> 
Unique password for each username.<br>
This feature will prevent hacking on data. If two or more different usernames can be signed up with the exactly same password then it will be easier to guess or try to hack an account.<br>
Only subscribers can read all contents.<br>
This feature can be developed to manage who can read credential materials.<br>

<br>
Evaluation II:<br>
Search results should be return on searchPage.html.<br>
I still haven't figured out on how to do this.<br>
Trending videos should be linked based on real users' views.<br>
Views of videos have to be counted and updated, then retrieve and link directly to trending videos.<br>
Trending videos should be displayed with images that are captured from videos instead of the videos themselves.<br>
This way can faster loading a page and direct users to articles that the videos are belonged to rather than just let users watch the videos without reading the related informations.<br>
